## PROMPT!

Established in early 2011 as an innovative community in New York City for entrepreneurs and startup companies, General Assembly is an educational institution that transforms thinkers into creators through education in technology, business and design at fifteen campuses across four continents.

In partnership with Hewlett Packard, General Assembly is hosting its first ever Android Hackathon the weekend of March 11 - March 13.

This weekend event will feature teams of students and alumni of General Assembly's Immersive programs in Android Development, UX Design, and Product Management. Teams will take ideas from concept to a functional Android app and every app will use one or more APIs provided by HPE Haven OnDemand (https://dev.havenondemand.com/apis).

Students who participate in the event will have a unique opportunity to work with some of the most advanced APIs around, enhance their portfolio, connect with members of the NYC tech community, and win prizes.

Teams will also have access to mentors from General Assembly, and at the end of the hackathon, teams will demo their apps to a panel of judges with the top apps receiving prizes sponsored by HPE.
